    "   - Each string is one line, including `\\n`.\n",
    "   - Useful when you want to iterate over all lines or process lines in memory.\n",
    "     \n",
    "3. `read()` – Read the Entire File as a Single String\n",
    "   - Reads the full content of the file at once.\n",
    "   - Useful when you want to process the entire file as text.\n",
    "   - Can split the string into lines using `.split(\"\\n\")` if needed.\n",
    "4. Iterating Directly Over the File\n",
    "   - The most memory-efficient method.\n",
    "   - Iterates line by line over the file object.\n",
    "   - Useful for large files where loading all lines into memory is not practical.\n"
